# melbthesis

LateX thesis template compatible with the [thesis guidelines](https://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/preparing-my-thesis/preparation-of-graduate-research-theses-rules) set forth by the University of Melbourne.
The template is a modified version of [Dissertate](https://github.com/suchow/Dissertate), updated to comply with the University of Melbourne guidelines and my own personal taste in 2021/2022.
